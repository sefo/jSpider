# jSpider

Basic use: java -jar jSpider.jar URL [dictionary file]

In console mode, if a dictionary file [optional] is not passed, the defaults folders.txt will be used.
If ran with no parameter, jSpider will run in GUI mode (in the works...)

You can try it directly by checking out https://github.com/sefo/jSpider/tree/master/distri and running:
./jSpider URL [dictionary]

TODO:
-Use independant thread to GET urls at the same time.
-Finish the swing user interface
-Implement (targeted) file bruteforcing
